  <h1>Introduction</h1> 
  
 <p>My Name is Spencer Hass. I graduated SUNY Albany in 2014 with a bachelors degree in Sociology with a minor in communications and business. While at Albany I had an opportunity to intern at a creative agency where they had web developers. I would watch them work and they seemed to be enjoying what they were doing. After graduation I had difficulty finding a job, so I decided to look more into web developing. I took a couple classes at my local community college and decided this is the right career path for me.</p>
